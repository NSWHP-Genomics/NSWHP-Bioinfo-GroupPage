Illumina NovaSeq 6000 is a powerful sequencing platform that can generate up to 6Tb of data per run. To maximize the sequencing capacity, it is common to multiplex multiple samples in a single sequencing run. To facilitate the multiplexing, Illumina has developed a SampleSheet.csv file that contains all the information required for the sequencing run. However, the SampleSheet.csv file is prone to human errors, which can lead to sequencing failure and data loss. To address this issue, we have developed a Python utility, sschecker, to enforce the SampleSheet.csv integrity. The sschecker utility can be easily integrated into the sequencing workflow to ensure the SampleSheet.csv integrity before the sequencing run. More detail please visit [sschecker home page](

Here, we present an R package that enables future utilization modelling based on historical time-series data and further support the evidence-based procurement decision making process by simulating financial outcomes on various procurement strategies. In addition, the proposed workflow is further supported by visualizations and an easy-to-use dashboard framework. More detail please visit [UtilityViz home page]().
