> Synopsis:\
> Symposium on Bioinformatics Engineering in Industry (SBEI2023) was a popular forum to include entrepreneurs, professionals and stakeholders from the life science and healthcare industry in a conversation on major trending topics in applications of bioinformatics in industry. This year, SBEI2023 was gathered in the picturesque sunshine :sun_with_face: coastal city :ocean: of Brisbane, Australia. The main themes for this year's discussion were wrapping around bioinformatics as a service, AI and advocacy in governance policy.

## Australia's Bioinformatics Industry landscape
Australia has a vibrant bioinformatics presence that intersects with many fields including but not limited to healthcare, pharmaceuticals and farming. Although the bioinformatics industry is growing rapidly, small and medium firms, as well as start-ups are facing hefty headwinds post-pedantic. Established practises on the other hand are confronted with the growing threat of cybersecurity and dwefling capacity in afforable storage solutions, the lack of coordinated strategies in managing the explosion of genomics data sent uneasiness through our professional community.

## Leverage analtyic AI in Bioinformatics context
AI has been a trendy topic in recent years, high enthusiasm has concentrated on the branch of regenerative AI. The bioinformatics community is bracing AI with open-arm, many attempts have been made in recent months to explore the potentials and the best areas in bioinformatics that AI has the capacity to made the most changes.

[CSL](https://www.csl.com/), a Melbourne head-officed global biotech leader and is venturing into pharmaceuticals in recent years with the high profile acquisition of Swiss Vifor, [demonstrated their passion and shared their strategic planning in regards to AI](https://www.csl.com/we-are-csl/vita-original-stories/2020/artificial-intelligence-at-csl). CSL also highlighted their efforts in promoting innovation in AI space by establishing a self-sufficient data model and integrating private, public and proprietary data.

Microba, a medium-sized Brisbane-based microbiome company, [has shared their efforts in exploring the potentials of AI in microbiome research](https://microba.com/au/ai-and-the-microbiome/). Microba has been working with the University of Queensland to develop AI models to predict the microbiome composition and the impact of microbiome on human health. Microba showcased their recent study in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and demonstrated the AI-enabled network analytics capacity in greatly improving the interpretability of microbiome interactome in humans.

A small Brisbane-based start-up Dose/Me, showcased their product on AI-enabled optimum precision dosing for renal impairment patients. The product is distributed as a software plugin that can be integrated into the hospital's electronic medical record (EMR) system, the systemm is currently under trial with a few hospitals in both Australia and the US. Dose/Me also shared their journey in development and commercialisation of the product, highlighted the funding challengings in post-pedantic era and emphesised the governance and complience gaps in data security. Dose/Me also demonstrated a pragmatic attitute towards AI to encourage the promotion of AI-enabled productivity growth rather than FOMO driven AI adoption, which I personally think was very refreshing.

Life Whisperer is a small Adelaide-based start-up that is working on AI-enabled embryo selection for IVF. Life Whisperer has been working with a few IVF clinics in Australia and the US to develop and commercialise the product. Life Whisperer shared their journey in developing the product and the challenges in commercialisation. Life Whisperer also shared their vision in the future of AI in IVF and the potential of AI in other areas of healthcare.

## Data Governance and Ethics
With the exploration of modern AI and the growing demand for data, data governance and ethics have become a hot topic in the industry. The bioinformatics community is no exception. The community is actively exploring the best practices in data governance and ethics. The community is also actively engaging with the government and the public to advocate for the best practices in data governance and ethics.
