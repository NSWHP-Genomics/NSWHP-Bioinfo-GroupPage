## Motivations
VSCode native development has grown to be a popular choice for many developers. Creating a VSCode native development environment for all team members will not only ensure a consistant development experience, but also reduce the onboarding time for new team members. With growing popularity of cloud computing, this blog aims to discuss a few common practical setups to enable a VSCode native development environment for AWS EC2.

## Introduction
VSCode supports [remote connection via SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh-tutorial), which is traditionally the *de fecto* route for remote development. However, SSH is not the only option, and due to the increaseing restrictions of SSH key pairs under corperate environment to avoid cyber attack (reducing attack surface), alternative connecting mechanism to cloud infrastructure like via [Amazon simple systems manager (SSM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/what-is-systems-manager.html) will be discuss futher in this post.
